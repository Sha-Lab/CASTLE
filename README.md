## Generalized Few-Shot Learning
Object recognition in the real-world requires handling long-tailed or even open-ended data. An ideal visual system needs to recognize the populated head visual concepts reliably and meanwhile efficiently learn about emerging new tail categories with a few training instances. Class-balanced many-shot learning and few-shot learning tackle one side of this problem, by either learning strong classifiers for head or learning to learn few-shot classifiers for the tail. We investigate the problem of generalized few-shot learning (GFSL) --- a model during the deployment is required to learn about tail categories with few shots and simultaneously classify the head classes.

## Adaptive Classifiers Synthesis
We propose the ClAssifier SynThesis LEarning (Castle), a learning framework that learns how to synthesize calibrated few-shot classifiers in addition to the multi-class classifiers of head classes with a shared neural dictionary, shedding light upon the inductive GFSL. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive version of Castle (ACastle) that adapts the head classifiers conditioned on the incoming tail training examples, yielding a framework that allows effective backward knowledge transfer. As a consequence, ACastle can handle GFSL with classes from heterogeneous domains.

## Generalized Few-shot Learning Results

Experimental results on MiniImageNet with ResNet-12 backbone (Same as [this repo](https://github.com/kjunelee/MetaOptNet)). We report average results with 10,000 randomly sampled few-shot learning episodes for stablized evaluation. Different from the standard few-shot learning, the model is required to discern over the novel classes and all SEEN classes.

### MiniImageNet Dataset

The MiniImageNet dataset is a subset of the ImageNet that includes a total number of 100 classes and 600 examples per class. We follow the [previous setup](https://github.com/twitter/meta-learning-lstm), and use 64 classes as SEEN categories, 16 and 20 as two sets of UNSEEN categories for model validation and evaluation, respectively. The auxiliary images for evaluating SEEN categories could be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gk0AsYUrN9NtLIDE9AKaZeVYzftpo6Ol?usp=sharing). 

### TieredImageNet Dataset
[TieredImageNet](https://github.com/renmengye/few-shot-ssl-public) is a large-scale dataset  with more categories, which contains 351, 97, and 160 categoriesfor model training, validation, and evaluation, respectively. The dataset can also be download from [here](https://github.com/kjunelee/MetaOptNet).
We only test TieredImageNet with ResNet backbone in our work. The auxiliary images for evaluating SEEN categories could be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19SGTIAnTmVohdSNN6Q9G5Qn3bVChOIMr?usp=sharing).

## Code Structures
To reproduce our experiments with FEAT, please use **train_gfsl.py**. **eval_gfsl** can evaluate a GFSL model dierectly. There are four parts in the code.
 - `model`: It contains the main files of the code, including the few-shot learning trainer, evaluator, the dataloader, the network architectures, baselines, and comparison models.
 - `data`: Images and splits for the data sets.
 - `saves`: The pre-trained weights of different networks.
 - `checkpoints`: To save the trained models.

## Arguments
The train_gfsl.py and eval_gfsl.py take similar command line options (details are in the `model/utils.py`):
